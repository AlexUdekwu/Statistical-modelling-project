# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)
To explore the citybikes API within the city of Vancouver and then identify areas of interest around the citybikes located in Vancouver using forusquare API and Yelps APi to identify restaurants and bars assessible by anoyone who visits the citybikes stations in Vancouver.
## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)
- Getting data from citybike api
- Getting data from foursquare api
- Gettng data from yelps api
- Cleaned all data to ensure duplicates are removed as well as colums with missing data removed.
- Joining of dataframes to identify areas of interest between the three dataframes
- Visualization and explaoration of data analysis using historgram, heatmap etc.
- Data model building where p-values was generated to confirm validity of data.

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)
a total of 245 citybikes were located with the api and when all dataframes were combined, generated 257 data on 8 columns making sure all data within the three dataframes were displayed on the tables with coreelations in place.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
Had challenges trying to set up the stretch of turning the regression model to a classification model.
## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
-To carry out from cleaning process on the NAN values on the tables
-Further research to understand the process of turning the regression model to a classification model.
